# CodeFest 2021 Entry _(1st place winner!)_

The prompt for this years CodeFest was to provide a proof of concept for a new product, or new feature set for an existing product, the firm could explore.

My team was made of up mostly Data Scientists and Data Analysts. I was the only UX representative, so I owned the front end development piece of our proposed solution.

## Our solution

Our team decided to implement a 2 part project: (1) a data driven suggestion to users based on their stated goals of working with the firm, and (2) a new way dahsboard and location to display this information to the user.

An example of the proposed data can be found in `src/MachineLearningData.json`
